# Catch a Cold

> Stay Alive for Christmas!

*On your way to your family's Christmas reunion, your car breaks down, due to a freak incident, on a dirt road in the middle of the wilderness. You are lost in a blizzard, and you must stay alive until help arrives (whenever that will be). To do this, you have to make use of your environment and your prepared inventory of camping items in creative and desperate ways.*

Catch a Cold is a first-person survival game that is being built in Unity.

## Installation

No versions have been released yet. That means that there's no current version :open_mouth:.

## Why Open Source?

I made this game open source because I'm addicted to open source.
