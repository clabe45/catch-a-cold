# Catch a Cold

> Stay Alive for Christmas!

*On your way to your family's Christmas reunion, your car breaks down, due to a freak incident, on a dirt road in the middle of the wilderness. You are lost in a blizzard, and you must stay alive until someone drives by (whenever that will be). To do this, you have to make use of your environment and your resources in creative and desperate ways.*

Catch a Cold is a small first-person survival game built in Unity. It's currently in development ([game design document](DESIGN.md)).

## Installation

## Why Open Source?

I made this game open source because I'm addicted to open source, and I like to contribute to the open source community.

(Only the source code is open. The assets are closed to the development team.)
