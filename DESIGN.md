# Catch a Cold
{catch phrase}

## Overview

### Concept

*Catch a Cold* is a survival game in which you have to stay warm on a snowy mountain. On your way to your family's Christmas reunion, your car breaks down due to a freak incident on a dirt road outside of civilization. You are lost in a blizzard, and you must stay alive until help arrives (whenever that will be). To do this, you have to make use of your environment and your prepared inventory of camping items in creative and desperate ways.

### Genre

Survival

### Target Audience

This game is meant for gamers who like playing survival games that take place in nature and thinking outside the box.

### Game Flow Summary

The player starts out on the peak of a snowy mountain, looking out over a cold wilderness of trees, rocks and snow. To stay alive, she must stay warm and eat. After a randomized length of time, help will arrive, and if the player is still alive, she wins.

### Look and Feel
*Catch a Cold* is low-poly.

## Gameplay and Mechanics

### Gameplay

To stay warm, the player must create and sustain fire, using his surroundings. To create fire, he must do one of the following:
* Collect (`RMB`) a *flintstone* (quartz, chert or obsidian), place it on the ground, and use (`RMB`) the knife in your prepared inventory on it. (*Required energy*: 1)
<!-- * Collect a board and a stick, and place the board on the ground and use the stick on it. (*Required energy*: 2) -->
* Collect and place something shiny (the player's soda can, his water bottle, his glasses) on the ground. If the sun hits it in the right way, fire will be created.

To sustain the fire, he must collect any sort of fuel and place (`RMB`) it on the fire.

The player starts out with 7 pieces of food.

The world is composed of the environment (which is static and unusable) and the entities (which can be picked up and moved).
